Installation Instructions

It's easy, follow the steps:
Filter Link on GitHub : https://github.com/schortin-nicolas/PoE_Item_Filter/releases

1) Click on the github URL using the link above.

2) Click on "Source code (zip)". You'll download the ZIP-file

3) Open the "download" folder on your PC, Rightclick the file and extract it. You'll need 7zip, winrar or winzip for that.

4) Copy/Paste the (.filter) file to your POE repository, under "C:\Users\your_username\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile\EssenceFilterShorty_v1_1.filter"
You can also access it In Game by navigate to the option menu, then UI tab, and at the bottom of the scroll tab :  Click on "Show filter folder".

5) Paste the file from step 3 there.

6) Scroll to the bottom of the interface tab again. You should now be able to select the filter(s) from the scrolldown menu. Enjoy :)

If you're experiencing problems: it's very very likely because you've failed extracting the files or pasted them to the wrong folder. The filter works for thousands of users, it should also work for you (yes also if you're using steam). You can also check out the POE wiki on filters.
If you want to edit the filter, I recommend using NotePad++ (google it).
